# April Fool's Ideas
* All upgrades also upgrade tanks
  * multi-lock weapons system would let them use both their siege and unsiege attack at the same time.
  * The first shoot-n-scoot upgrade lets them move while sieged, the second lets them fire while moving while sieged
  * Just have like 4 submenus to fit all the abilities
  * start them at 10 HP, but every defense and health upgrade stacks on them
  * reaper flight lets them fly
  * Envy: "replacing their siege mode animation with the majora's mask deku scrub flower-burrow effect"
* Add-ons lift off instead of buildings
* Wraithwalker: Wrathwalkers are cloaked while moving
* Weeb overlords:
  * Ora Ora Ora (Overlord): Barrage of leviathan tentacles hit an enemy
  * Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru (Overlord): Teleport behind an enemy air unit and kill it
* Wraiths can merge into ringwraiths, a fast mounted melee warrior with detection
  * Envy: Can't be killed by male units
* Spawn Broodlings: unlimited range
  * Give it a new sound effect: "Fenix! No!"
* Swap disruptor and adept abilities. Preferably randomly
* Infestor -> Investor
  * Old abilities cost minerals instead of energy
  * Stonks (Investor): pay minerals for income (50 minerals to get 15 minerals every ten seconds for 1 minute)
  * Mineral Futures (Investor): Pay energy for more minerals in a patch
* Firebats: 10x range (Salz)
* Spine crawlers: like 20 range
* Have a way to make buildings non-grid aligned


## Renames
* Marine -> Man with Gun
* Marauder -> Marine
* Firebat -> Fiberat
* Liberators -> Liberals
* Midnight Riders -> Civil War Reference
* Zergling -> Lester

* Infestor -> Investor
  * Infested Terran -> Crypto Bro
  * Fungal Growth -> Pump and Dump

## Traps / mutators
* Amicide -- Everything does a little splash. Everything does friendly-fire

## Maps
* Harvest of Screams: Cover the entire map in arrows pointing at Nafash's vanilla location. Move Nafash somewhere else.
